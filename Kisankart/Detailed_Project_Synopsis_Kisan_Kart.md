## I. Title of the Project

**Kisan Kart - Connecting Farmers and Customers: An Advanced E-commerce Platform for Agricultural Products with AI-Powered Customer Support and Comprehensive Digital Solutions**

---

## II. Statement of the Problem

The agricultural sector in India faces multifaceted challenges that significantly impact both farmers and consumers. Farmers struggle with:

1. **Intermediary Exploitation**: Multiple middlemen in the supply chain reduce farmers' profit margins by 40-60%, while inflating consumer prices.

2. **Limited Market Access**: Farmers lack direct access to urban consumers and market information, restricting their ability to plan production effectively.

3. **Price Volatility**: Absence of transparent pricing mechanisms leads to unpredictable income for farmers.

4. **Digital Divide**: Limited technological adoption prevents farmers from leveraging modern marketing channels.

On the consumer side, challenges include:

1. **Quality Concerns**: Lack of transparency about product origin, farming practices, and freshness.

2. **Inflated Prices**: Extended supply chains result in higher costs for consumers.

3. **Limited Variety**: Restricted access to diverse, seasonal, and locally-grown produce.

4. **Trust Issues**: Absence of reliable feedback mechanisms and quality assurance.

The current agricultural marketing system is inefficient, with farmers receiving only 20-25% of the final consumer price. This project addresses these systemic issues by creating a comprehensive digital platform that eliminates intermediaries, ensures transparency, and provides advanced features like AI-powered customer support, secure payment systems, and real-time order tracking.

- Integration of modern web technologies (Node.js, Express.js, MySQL) with agricultural commerce
- Implementation of AI-powered chatbot for customer support
- Advanced security features including OTP verification and JWT authentication
- Real-time order tracking and inventory management

### 4. **Digital Transformation**
- Promotes digital literacy among farmers
- Bridges the technology gap in rural areas
- Enables data-driven decision making for farmers

### 5. **Sustainability Goals**
- Reduces carbon footprint by eliminating multiple transportation layers
- Promotes sustainable farming practices through direct farmer-consumer communication
